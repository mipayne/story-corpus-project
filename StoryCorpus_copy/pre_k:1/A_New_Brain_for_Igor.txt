This is Igor. He works for Master. Igor wants to be smart like Master. But Igor's brain is very small. Master can make robots. Igor can't even make paper dolls. Master can wake the dead. Igor can't even wake his hamster, Peggy. Igor is unhappy. "I want to be smart like Master," he tells Peggy. "I want a new brain. A big brain. But how can I make Master give me one?" Igor thinks and thinks. Then he smiles a sly smile. Igor has a plan! Igor follows Master all around the lab. What does Master love best? More than anything, Master loves his fuzzy pink slippers. His grammy gave them to him. That night Igor creeps into Master's room. Master is asleep. Igor takes off the fuzzy pink slippers. Master wakes up. "What are you doing with my fuzzy pink slippers? Give them back!" Igor runs out of the room. He hides Master's fuzzy pink slippers. "Give me a big new brain. Then I will give back your fuzzy pink slippers!" Igor shouts. Master looks everywhere for his fuzzy pink slippers. He looks under Igor's bed. He looks in Igor's closet. No slippers! He looks in the fridge. He looks in the shower. He even checks the toilet! The slippers are nowhere to be found! Master sobs and sobs. "My grammy gave me those slippers. I must have them! I will give you a new brain!" Master cries. Master puts Igor on a table. Igor is asleep. He takes out Igor's small brain. He puts in a new, bigger brain. A little later Igor wakes up. He jumps up and down. He is so happy. Yes! He has a new brain... a bigger brain... a doggy brain! He licks Master's face. He pants with joy. "Good boy, Igor," says Master. "Now fetch my fuzzy pink slippers." And Igor does.
