Emma liked to march. She marched in her bedroom. She marched to the bathroom. Her dog, Pickle, marched behind her. At school everyone was preparing for Grandparents Day. Emma’s class was forming a marching band. Miss Cathy asked, “Who wants to be the leader?” Lots of hands went up, but not Emma’s. Emma wanted to be the leader, but she wasn’t sure she could do it. Miss Cathy could tell that Emma wanted to try. “How about you, Emma?” asked Miss Cathy. “You would make a fine leader.” Emma thought for a minute. “Okay,” she said. “I’ll do my best.” “Let’s make two lines,” said Miss Cathy. “One on the left behind me.” “And the other line,” she added, “will be on the right behind Emma.” “Come on, Ajay and Camille,” said Percy. “Let’s line up on the left behind Miss Cathy.” Freda, Carlos, and Mr.D. stepped behind Emma on the right. “Now, start with your left foot,” said Miss Cathy. “Which one is that?” Emma whispered. “This one,” said Freda, as she tapped Emma’s left knee. “Now, your right foot,” said Miss Cathy. “Forward, march! Left! Right! Left! Right!” Emma still wasn’t sure which way was left and which way was right. Miss Cathy took a red string from her pocket and tied it on Emma’s right arm. “This will help you remember,” she explained. “I get it!” said Percy. “The red string means right, and no string means left.” They started to march. “Now, my line will turn left,” said Miss Cathy. “Your line will turn right,” Miss Cathy added. “Red string means right,” thought Emma. Both lines turned perfectly. Every night, Emma practiced at home. Pickle helped her. “Left! Right! Left! Right!” said Emma. They marched all around the house. It was finally Grandparents Day. “This time, make one long line behind Emma. Now, start with your left foot,” Miss Cathy said. Emma didn’t need to look at her red string anymore. The band marched and played. They turned left. They turned right. All the grandparents stood up and cheered. Pickle wagged his tail—from left to right!
