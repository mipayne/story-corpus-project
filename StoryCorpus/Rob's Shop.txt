Hi! I am Rob. This is my shop. I live on top. I have lots of jobs to do. What are my jobs? I will tell you. I get up at six each day. I go down to unlock my shop. Come in and look! Would you like milk? Would you like ham? Would you like nuts or gum or jam? I could sell them all to you! I fill my shop. I get out sacks and big bags. I stack cans on top of cans. I stock the racks with lots of things. Then I check the shop. If there is a spill, I mop it up. I dust here and there. I brush things into my dustpan. I am no slob! People come into my shop. Then I rush, rush, rush! I make them buns with gobs of jam. I make big, thick subs. I make them ham and eggs. I make corn on the cob. People like the things I make. More and more people come in. They ask for things. They get this and that. I pack their bags. I stuff their packs. They hand me cash. I say, “Thanks.” They say, “Good-bye.” At six I stop. I look at my shop. Have I done all my jobs? Is there more I could do? I look at my list. Yes, there is more than this. There is one more job. Shut the shop and go up top!
