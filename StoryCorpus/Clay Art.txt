Follow me. I’m going to make clay art. First, I draw a sketch. Then I roll the clay. Next, I shape the clay. Sometimes, I add more clay. Now I wait for the clay to dry. Later, I fire the clay. Then I paint the clay. Now I can make… animals, mobiles, music boxes, and necklaces. I can even make finger puppets!
