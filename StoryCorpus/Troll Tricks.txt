Once there were three Billy Goats Gruff. They wanted to go to the hill with green grass. Brave Little Goat Gruff went trip, trap, trip, trap. “Who goes on my bridge?” said Troll. “It’s Little Goat Gruff. Can I pass?” asked the little goat. “Trick me with three jokes,” said Troll. “Or you will be my next meal!” “What did the little goat say after he made a joke?” “Why don’t little goats work?” “What did the little troll say when there were too many trolls in the bed?” “Go over!” Trip, trap, trip, trap. Big Goat Gruff asked, “Can I pass?” “Trick me,” said Troll. “That’s the deal. Or you will be my next meal!” “How do trolls sing?” “What do trolls like to play on the drums?” “What do goats like to hum on a lake?” “Go over!” Trip, trap, trip, trap. Grand Goat Gruff asked, “Can I pass?” “Trick me,” said Troll. “That’s the deal. Or you will be my next meal!” “What does a goat like to eat?” “Grrrr” “What does a troll use to bake a pie?” “Why can’t you say things when a goat is there?” “Grrrr” “You tricked me three times,” said Troll. “Now I will trick you!” Then Grand Goat Gruff asked… “What do you say when three goats are about to catch a troll?” And that was no joke for Troll!
