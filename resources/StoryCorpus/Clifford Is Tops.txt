My pop had a red car. The red car did not go. “Oh, no!” said Pop. I said, “Stop, Clifford.” I said, “Drop, Clifford. Help my pop.” I said, “Hop on, Pop.” My pop was up, up, up! Clifford ran and ran. He ran with Pop on top. Pop got to the shop where Mom was. Clifford ran home to me with Mom and Pop. I said, “Drop, Clifford. Come down, Mom. Come down, Pop.” Clifford is tops!
