Chuck had a very big lunch. His dad packed a cheese sandwich, chips, a big peach, and a pink drink in a lunch bag. But when he went to get the lunch, it was not there! “Where is my lunch?” yelled Chuck. “I must look for it!” Chuck ran into three little pigs. One had a home of grass. One had a home of sticks. One had a home of red bricks. “Have you seen my lunch?” asked Chuck. “No,” said the pigs. “You can huff and puff, but we have not.” Next, Chuck ran into a very big man who looked mad. “Have you seen my lunch?” asked Chuck. “No!” yelled the very big man. “Have you seen a lad with a bag of black beans? He took my best hen!” “No,” said Chuck. “I have not.” “Then get out!” yelled the very big man. He chased Chuck away. Chuck then ran into a brown baby bear who looked sad. “Have you seen my lunch?” asked Chuck. “No,” said the baby bear. “Did you see a little girl go by? She sat on my yellow chair and broke it.” “No,” said Chuck, and he went on. Chuck then ran into three gruff goats. Each goat was eating a pile of green grass. A mean little man was sitting by a blue creek. “Have you seen my lunch?” asked Chuck. “Chomp,” said the big goat. “Munch,” said the little goat. “No, no, no,” said the very little goat. Just then, Chuck saw two kids on a hill. He ran up to them and asked, “Have you seen my lunch?” “No,” said Jack and Jill. Jack was eating a cheese sandwich. Jill was eating a big peach. “Chips?” they asked. “My lunch!” smiled Chuck.
