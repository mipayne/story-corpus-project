Max loves pizza. It must be grand. So, let’s make one in Dragon Land! Mix it. Twirl it. Toss it high! What goes on a pizza pie? Zak says, “Horseflies go on top, with earmuffs, drums, and green gumdrops!” Wheezie says, “No, a flute and horn, with fairy shoes and pink popcorn!” Horseflies flutes, and horns? Oh, my! Is this what goes on pizza pie? Let’s ask Cassie! She might know what goes best on pizza dough. Cassie knows just who to ask. Max loves pizza. Let’s ask Max! “Hey!” says Max. “We all can make it.” “These go on top.” “Then you bake it!” And in the blink of a dragon’s eye, they make a dragon pizza pie! Good job, Emmy, Wheezie, Zak! Good job, Cassie… Ord and Max!
