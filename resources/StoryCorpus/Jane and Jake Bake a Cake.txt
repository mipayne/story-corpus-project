“What a day,” said Jane. “It is so wet out. What can we do on a day like this?” “Let’s make a cake,” said Jake. “Make a cake! How?” said Jane. “You just mix this and that and bake,” Jake said. “We are smart apes. We can do it.” Jane got a book from the shelf. “Let’s look in this book first,” Jane said. “It will tell us how to make a cake.” Jake made a face. “That will take so long,” he said. “This is not a race,” said Jane. “I like to race,” said Jake. “I like to do things fast.” “I will not rush,” said Jane. “We have two pans and many, many eggs,” Jake said. “We can each make a cake.” “You can take as long as you like,” Jake said to Jane. “I will race on. I will make my cake first!” “But how will your cake taste?” said Jane. “Let’s look at the book,” Jane said to Jake. “Crack two eggs in a cup. Add a cup of milk.” “Too late,” said Jake. “I have put in my eggs and milk. I am fast, fast, fast. Hmmm. I see a can of pop,” said Jake. “I can shake the can. I can add fizz to my cake.” “I have two cups that are the same,” Jane said. “First I will fill one cup from this bag. I will fill the other cup from that bag. Then I will mix each cup in.” “I will shake in some of this stuff,” Jake said. “I will mix in some of that stuff. Yes! I like the taste of my cake.” Jake had a big grin on his face. Jane cut up things for her cake. She still had to mix. She still had to put the cake mix in the pan. “Ha!” said Jake. “I am all set to bake my cake.” “What is that?” he said. “I see one more thing I could use. GUM! I like the taste of this pink gum. It will go in my cake,” Jake said. “Now I can bake.” “I put my cake in to bake,” Jake said to Jane. “Get the plates!” “Look at this place,” said Jane. “It is a mess!” POP! “What was that?” said Jake. “It came from your cake,” said Jane. “Look out!” said Jake. The cake gave a shake. POP! POP! POP! Jake had cake on his face. So did Jane. “What was in that cake?” said Jane. “Gum,” said Jake. “Yum,” said Jane. So the apes ate all the cake!
