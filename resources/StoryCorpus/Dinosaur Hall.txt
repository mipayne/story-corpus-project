Calling one, Calling all! Come see what’s here at Dinosaur Hall. Dinosaurs big and dinosaurs small. Dinosaurs, dinosaurs! We have them all! Dinosaur maps are here for us all, to show us the way around Dinosaur Hall. Dinosaurs long and dinosaurs tall, they are all here at Dinosaur Hall. Dinosaurs with plates and dinosaurs with sails. Dinosaurs with spikes up and down their tails. Dinosaurs with horns, one, two, three! Is this the dinosaur you came to see? Dinosaurs little, dinosaurs so small. Does this one look like a dinosaur at all? Dinosaurs with bills, dinosaurs with crests. So many dinosaurs! Come see the rest. Dinosaurs eating plants, dinosaurs eating meat. It’s a dinosaur show! Come get a seat. Dinosaur bones can tell us more about the dinosaurs that lived here before. Dinosaur teeth and dinosaur jaws. Dinosaur feet and dinosaur claws. A dinosaur baby so cute in its nest. Look at that big one! It must be T-Rex! Today there are no dinosaurs at all, but you can still see them at the Dinosaur Hall. Can you name these dinosaurs?
