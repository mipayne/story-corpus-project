Lee ate some popcorn and threw the bag away. The wind picked it up and blew it away. The dog picked it up and took it away. The ants picked it up and dragged it away. The bird picked it up and carried it away. The rain picked it up and washed it away. Guess what Lee did? Lee picked it up and threw it away, again!
