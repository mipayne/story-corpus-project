Two cute mice were in their beds, side by side. Then the sun came up. It was a new day. CRACK! The mice woke up. "What was that?" said one. "Let's find out!" said the other. The mice were out of bed, fast! They got up on a box. "Look!" said one. "Yikes!" said the other. "Ice! Ice! Ice!" said the mice. They put on their new hats. They put on their new boots. Then the mice went out. "Look what broke off the pine tree," said one. "Let me see," said the other. The mice slid down. They could not stop. Plop! Mice on ice! The mice ran off to find their sled. "Take this rope," said one. "Here we go!" said the other. The sled shot over the ice. The mice wove in and out of the trees. They rode for a mile. Then they came to a log. The sled went over the top. The mice did not. Flop! Mice on ice! The mice got back up. "Look, there is Fox," said one. "He can run fast over the ice!" "Fox, fox!" yelled the mice. "Take us for a ride." Fox gave the mice a big, wide smile. "I will take you for a ride," he said. "Use my tail." "Oh no!" said one. "Let go!" said the other. Spill! Mice on ice! "That was close!" said one of the mice. "It was no joke!" said the other. Now the mice were at a big, wide pond. They went and got skates. "Look at me glide!" said one. "Look at me jump!" said the other. "Look at us!" said the mice. "We are so cute!" The mice spun on their skates. They were fast, fast, fast... Flip! Mice on ice! The mice ran back to their tree. "Look at all that long, long ice" said one. "Let's take a lick," said the other. One of the mice hit part of the long ice. The ice broke off. "Quick!" said the mice. Crash! Mice on ice! Now it was late in the day. The sun went down. "My nose is as red as a rose!" said one of the mice. "My hands are as cold as ice!" said the other. "Time to go home," they said. The mice took off their new hats and boots. They got back in bed, side by side. "Ice is nice," said the mice, "but home is twice as nice!"
