"Open it up," said the pup.  "How?" said the cow. "I'll use force," said the horse. "Use a bat," said the rat.  "I will try," said the fly. "Good luck," said the duck.  "Beware!" said the hare. Then the fox and the bird and the cat and the crow and the pig and the bee and the pup and the cow and the horse and the rat and the fly and the duck and the hare said, "See you later, alligator!"
