Bo has lots of bows! She has red bows with dots, yellow bows with stripes, and blue bows with checks. Bo is Mother Bear's girl. Mother Bear likes to come home from work to play and cook with Bo. Oh, oh! Here comes the snow! Mother Bear and Bo are stuck at home. They can't go to work or out to play. What can they do? They plan a tea party. What can they make? They read a book that shows lots of cakes. They see nice lime cakes and small yellow cupcakes. "Mud cakes, too?" asks Bo. Mother Bear says, "No, Bo!" It will be a big party. They want lots and lots of cakes to eat. Bo makes a list of things to get. The list grows and grows. They mix up all the things. Bo has her own bowl. Plop! Bo's bow goes into the big bowl. Bo does not see it go in. Mother Bear puts the mix in a pan. Bo gets to lick the bowl. They bake the cupcakes in the oven. Look at them! The cupcakes flow over the sides of the pan. Bo calls her friends to come to the party. "Bring your father, mother, sister, or brother!" she says. Bo's friends come, slipping and stomping in the snow. "Come in for tea!" says Bo. There is a rainbow of cakes for all to eat. Oh, oh! One of them has a bow!
