"What can I play in the rain?" Sam asked his father. "It is raining just a little bit," said his father. "Let's take a walk." Sam and his father came to a trail. "Where does the trail go?" asked Sam. "Wait and see," said his father. Then Sam saw tracks in the mud. "What made these tracks?" he asked. "Wait and see," said his father. Sam and his father saw that the tracks made a trail. The trail went all the way to the lake. The boy and his father went to the shore of the lake. "Look! It's a frog!" said Sam. "I think the frog made the tracks." "Those little black spots are frog eggs," Sam's father said. "Frogs lay eggs in the lake." "When will the eggs turn into frogs?" asked Sam. "Wait and see," said his father. "Will the mother raise the eggs?" Sam asked. "No, Sam. The eggs will grow without help." "Can we stay and see the eggs turn into frogs?" Sam asked. "It won't happen today, Sam. We will come back to see them." Sam waited. In two weeks there were tadpoles by the shore. "They have tails!" said Sam. Sam waited and waited. In five weeks the tadpoles had legs. "When will they be frogs?" Sam asked. "Wait and see," said his father. The next time Sam an this father went back to the lake, they saw lots of little frogs!
