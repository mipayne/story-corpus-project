We took a trip to the beach. We wanted to see the sea. Captain Ted was at the dock. He called, "Come sail with me." "I must tell you, fish are fast. Keep your eye on the water for what swims past." "Look over there at the flashes of green. It's fast fish in their school, too quick to be seen." We looked at the fish until a big fish swam past. It ate eight fish at once. Small fish must swim fast! This sawfish has a jaw like a saw, but it's not for sawing wood. It uses its jaw to dig things up. It would not saw wood if it could. We saw two starfish, too. One had four arms, not five. It will grow more. It can heal. That's how starfish survive. Far away we could see a fin swim up and back. Ted turned his wheel and said, "We will not be its snack!" "Over there are blue whale tails. I see one, two, three. Oh, what tales whales could tell of life under the sea." "Do you hear that?" asked Ted. "Here are seals in the sun. They swim and eat and sleep all day. Life for them must be fun." Back at the dock Ted waved, and we all said good-bye. "Come back one day," he said. "I am glad that you came by."
